# 🎮 Python for Game Programming: Pygame from A to Z

This repository contains all my code, projects, and learning materials from the Udemy course  
**"Python for Game Programming: Pygame from A to Z – Mastering the Art of 2D Game Development with Python and Pygame."**

---

## 🚀 About the Course
This course focuses on mastering **2D game development** using **Python** and the **Pygame library**.  
It covers everything from basic game setup to designing, coding, debugging, and deploying your own games.

You’ll not only learn **how to build games**, but also understand the **core principles of game design, event handling, and optimization**.

---

## 🧠 What I’ll Learn
- Understand the **foundational principles of game development** and how they’re implemented in Python using Pygame.  
- **Develop and design 2D games** from scratch, including platformers, puzzles, and arcade-style games.  
- Use **graphics, sound effects, and user input** to make interactive games.  
- **Debug and optimize** gameplay for smooth performance and stability.  
- Implement **physics and controls**, including collision detection and character animation.  
- Manage **game states and screen transitions** (start, pause, end).  
- Design and manage **game assets** (sprites, backgrounds, and UI elements).  
- Follow **best practices** for structuring game projects.  
- Learn how to **package and deploy** completed Pygame applications.

## 🕹️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pygame**
- (Optional tools as the course progresses)
  - Pillow (for image handling)
  - Audacity / FreeSound (for audio)
  - Visual Studio Code

## 🧩 Learning Goal
By the end of this course, I aim to:
- Be comfortable creating complete 2D games using Python & Pygame.
- Understand how to handle graphics, sounds, animations, and events.
- Build my own **mini-games portfolio** and publish them online.
